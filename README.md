# SLR on Linked List Optimization for Intel Xeon Cache/Prefetchers
This project conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to analyze research trends in optimizing linked list performance concerning cache and hardware prefetchers on modern Intel Xeon server CPUs.

## Project Goal
To identify, synthesize, and evaluate techniques for linked list optimization on selected Intel Xeon generations (Skylake-SP, Cascade Lake-SP, Ice Lake-SP), focusing on cache/prefetcher interactions and their impact on linked list traversal.
